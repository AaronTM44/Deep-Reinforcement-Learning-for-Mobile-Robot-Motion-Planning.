# SAC and TD3 algorithms for Mobile Robot Navigation. 
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a Machine Learing Algorithms where an agent learns by trial and error. This project implements the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithms for mobile robot navigation. The aim is to enable autonomous navigation of a mobile robot in complex environments using these state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques.

### Enviroment and Robot Platform

 Enviroment - openai gym or other custurm envrinments 
 Robot platform urdf/sdf

 ## Video Demonstration
 A DRL agent trained to navigate a mobile robot. 
 The enviroment data is a laser data of size 20
 and the action space is 2. Linear velocity and angular velocity (continuous). the mobile robot used here is Pioneer 3DX.
